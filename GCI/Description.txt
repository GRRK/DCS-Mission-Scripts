Ground Controlled Interception - script by RagnarDa 2013/2014

This is a script that I started more than a year ago that simulates the commanding of air assets to defend a region against enemy air intruders. It simulates the radar coverage of different radar stations (EWR, AWACS, SAMs, ships or visual) and when it detects an enemy aircraft it spawns a interceptor flight (fighters) that are continually steered towards an optimal interception point, as long as the radars can see the enemy target. Radar simulation includes line-of-sight, ground interference and doppler-shift detection. Note that it is possible to shake off an incoming fighter group by speeding up, diving behind a mountain (or notching) and then changing direction as the fighters will now look for you at the location you where supposed to be at if you hadn't changed course. It is also possible to configure the fighters to only use their radar (or not at all) once they are in a firing position which means that when you see the numbers on the RWR you are only a second or two from being shot at. The mission profile of the interceptors is also configurable so you can have “look-up/shoot-up”-only capable fighters (like MiG-21) fly a low-high-low profile in which they will attack from below or you can have “look-down/shoot-down” capable fighters (like MiG-25) fly a high-low-high profile in which they will hunt and attack you from high altitude. You can also have the player as an interceptor in which the player will be instructed to fly towards the target using text in the upper right section of the screen.

Another feature of the script is the “divertables” that is demonstrated in this video:

Note that the bomber decided to go home once the player has stayed on his wing for a while. This feature is also possible to use without the GCI-instructions, and only use AWACS or LotATC for example.
